# Normal-Distribution-and-Fill-Rate
In this exercise, we will apply the concept of the multivariate normal distribution to solve an inventory planning problem.  The goal is to answer the question:  “If one store needs 1,212 units of inventory, how much should the retailer keep in the warehouse to guarantee a 95% fill rate for two stores with similar sales patterns?”
